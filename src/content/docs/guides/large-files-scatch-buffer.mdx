# Managing Large Files in Neovim

## Level 1: Emergency Room (Copy-Paste Heroes)

### "Seven Things They Don't Tell You About Text Editors"

You open up a big file and you start seeing lags and slowdowns.

Why is it? Big files make too many computations you don't see.

Usually what we see is what's important. In the first solution we look to minimize unwanted operations.

First disable things that run in the background.

So we disable things we don't need in the background so they don't take unneeded memory:

<VimEnhancer description="Emergency performance rescue" />

```vim
:syntax off
```

Easy!

Your editor breathes again. The syntax highlighting was eating all the cycles.

Want more speed? Turn off other background processes:

<VimEnhancer description="More emergency tweaks" />

```vim
:set synmaxcol=200
:set maxmempattern=5000
```

**Duration:** 30 seconds of copy-paste.
**Classification:** Instant relief.

### "Why Your Computer Hates Big Files (And What You Can Do About It)"

You need to experiment with chunks of that monster file.

But you don't want to touch the original. What if you break something?

The solution is isolation. We make a workspace that vanishes when we're done.

So we create a scratch buffer that gives us freedom to experiment:

<VimEnhancer description="Create scratch workspace" />

```vim
:vnew
```

Easy!

Now you have a safe space. Copy parts of your big file here. Break it. Fix it. No consequences.

Need syntax highlighting back in your scratch area?

<VimEnhancer description="Make scratch buffer pretty" />

```vim
:set ft=json
```

**Duration:** 1 minute to master.
**Classification:** Essential safety net.

## Level 2: Smart Escapes (External Tools to the Rescue)

### "Things I Don't Understand About Software Development"

Your JSON file is so big that even looking at it hurts.

Why fight the editor? Sometimes the right tool is outside the editor.

The solution is delegation. Let specialized tools handle the heavy lifting.

So we pipe the file to tools built for this exact problem:

<VimEnhancer description="Browse JSON like a book" />

```bash
jq '.' huge.json | less
```

Easy!

Now you're browsing formatted JSON with `j/k` navigation. Search with `/`. Quit with `q`.

Need specific pieces of data?

<VimEnhancer description="JSON surgery with jq" />

```bash
jq '.users[0]' huge.json
jq '.items[] | select(.price > 100)' huge.json
```

**Duration:** 5 minutes to feel confident.
**Classification:** External tool magic.

### "Why Everything Has to Be So Damn Complicated"

Every time you open a big file, you remember to turn things off. Then you forget. Then you suffer.

Why remember when the computer can remember for you?

The solution is automation. We teach Neovim to detect big files and handle them automatically.

So we configure automatic optimization that triggers before the file even loads:

<VimEnhancer description="Auto-disable features for huge files" />

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufReadPre", {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    local file_size = vim.fn.getfsize(vim.fn.expand("%"))
    if file_size > 1024 * 1024 then
      vim.opt_local.syntax = "off"
      vim.opt_local.filetype = ""
      vim.opt_local.undolevels = -1
    end
  end,
})
```

Easy!

Files over 1MB get the performance treatment automatically. You never think about it again.

**Duration:** 2 minutes to configure forever.
**Classification:** Set-and-forget automation.

## Level 3: Power User Territory (Install Required)

### "The Stuff Nobody Tells You About Being a Programmer"

jq is great but sometimes you want to click around and explore.

Why type commands when you can navigate visually?

The solution is interactive exploration. We bring a JSON browser into our workflow.

So we install fx and pipe our buffer content to it:

<VimEnhancer description="Install the JSON explorer" />

```bash
npm install -g fx
```

<VimEnhancer description="Send buffer to fx viewer" />

```vim
:%w !fx
```

Easy!

Arrow keys navigate the structure. Space expands nodes. `/` searches. It's like a file manager for JSON.

**Duration:** 10 minutes including installation.
**Classification:** Interactive power tool.

### "Modern Technology: Making Simple Things Impossible Since 1995"

fx is awesome but you have to leave Neovim to use it.

Why leave your editor when you can bring the tool inside?

The solution is integration. We embed fx in a terminal split.

So we create a keymap that saves and opens fx without leaving Neovim:

<VimEnhancer description="fx integration keybinding" />

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>fx', function()
  vim.cmd('write')
  vim.cmd('split term://fx ' .. vim.fn.expand('%'))
end, { desc = 'Open JSON in fx' })
```

Easy!

Press `<leader>fx` and boom - fx opens in a split with your current file.

**Duration:** 15 minutes to configure and test.
**Classification:** Workflow integration.

## Level 4: Ninja Status (Custom Workflows)

### "Have You Ever Noticed How Programmers Love to Overcomplicate Everything?"

fx is nice but you're a Vim person. You want hjkl navigation.

Why adapt to new keybindings when you can use the ones in your muscle memory?

The solution is Vim-style tools. We find JSON browsers that speak your language.

So we install jless which navigates exactly like Vim:

<VimEnhancer description="Install jless JSON browser" />

```bash
cargo install jless
jless huge.json
```

Easy!

hjkl moves around. Nodes collapse and expand. Search works. It's Vim but for JSON.

**Duration:** 20 minutes including Rust setup.
**Classification:** Vim-native power tool.

### "The Weird Things People Do With Computers"

You do great work in scratch buffers but then lose it when you close Neovim.

Why lose good work just because it started as an experiment?

The solution is smart saving. We make it easy to persist scratch work.

So we create a keymap that prompts for a filename and saves our scratch buffer:

<VimEnhancer description="Smart scratch buffer saving" />

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ws', function()
  local filename = vim.fn.input('Save as: ')
  if filename ~= '' then
    vim.cmd('write ' .. filename)
  end
end, { desc = 'Save scratch as...' })
```

Easy!

Press `<leader>ws`, type a filename, and your scratch work becomes permanent.

**Duration:** 30 minutes to integrate into workflow.
**Classification:** Workflow preservation.

## The Strategy

**Level 1:** When things get slow, turn stuff off. Start here.

**Level 2:** When you need to explore, use the right tools. jq and automation.

**Level 3:** When you work with big files regularly, integrate the tools. fx inside Neovim.

**Level 4:** When you want total control, build custom workflows. Vim-style tools and smart saving.

Master scratch buffers first. They're your safety net for everything else.

Each level builds on the last. But you can jump around based on what you need right now.
